# Python Projects

Project 1- Wrote a Python program that declared two variables storing two numbers. Program included printing 4 lines showing the sum, product, difference and quotient of the two numbers

Project 2- Created a program that counts input length without spaces, periods or commas. The solution implemented looping and did not use Python in-built functions. The program would output the number of characters excluding spaces, periods, or commas.

Project 3- Wrote a program that accepted three grades from the user and calculated the average grade. Used conditional statements to determine the letter grade for the calculated average grade. 

Project 4- Wrote a program using functions for sum, add, multiply and divide. Each function took two arguments and returned a single value. 

Project 5- Modified project 4 to include a class that contains functions for each math operation. All four functions returned corresponding results and all printing was handled from the main program created. 

Fashion Shop Assignment (Project 6)- Created a Fashion shop application with given BTCInput. All classes were included in order to the the application fully functional 

Project 7- Created an application that recorded purchased grocery items. The user is prompted to enter the grocery item, name, quantity, and price. Grocery details were stored in a dictionary using a given format. Loop was implemented for the user to record all grocery items and to print grocery items along with the total price.

Project 8- Deployed Project 5 using AWS CodeDeploy.

Project 9- Created four tests using the assert and unittest method to test the Fashion Shop application from project 6. Included a detailed report explaining the aspects of the application that was chosen to test.

GUI Calculator (Project 10)- Created a GUI calculator using Project 5.
